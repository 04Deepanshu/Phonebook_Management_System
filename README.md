# Phonebook_Management_System

The phonebook management system, implemented in C++ using object-oriented programming principles and file handling techniques, is a comprehensive and efficient solution for organizing and managing contact information. With a focus on modularity and extensibility, the system incorporates various classes and functions to provide essential features such as adding, deleting, sorting, and searching contacts.

The core structure of the system revolves around classes that represent contacts and the phonebook itself. These classes leverage object-oriented programming concepts to encapsulate relevant data and operations, ensuring clean code organization and easy maintenance.

Users can effortlessly add new contacts to the phonebook, providing details such as name and phone number. The system handles the creation and storage of contacts, facilitating easy retrieval and manipulation.

Deleting contacts is a seamless process, allowing users to remove unwanted entries from the phonebook effortlessly. The system ensures data integrity and updates the phonebook accordingly.

To enhance usability, the system incorporates sorting functionality, enabling contacts to be arranged alphabetically or based on specific criteria. This simplifies contact lookup and improves overall efficiency.

The search feature empowers users to quickly find specific contacts within the phonebook. The system facilitates both name-based and number-based searches, providing accurate and instant results.

Furthermore, the system incorporates file handling techniques to store contact data persistently. Contacts can be saved to a file, ensuring data availability across multiple program runs. The system retrieves the saved data when launched, maintaining continuity and preserving the user's contact information.

By combining the power of object-oriented programming, file handling, and essential contact management functionalities, the phonebook management system in C++ provides a reliable and user-friendly solution for efficiently organizing, accessing, and manipulating contact information.
